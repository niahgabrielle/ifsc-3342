  <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>I would like to start by saying that this course was very beneficial to me actually. I know that I will have to do some of these things for clients in the future when working in web design. I can’t wait for IT & Apps next semester. In the beginning, I learned HTML5 Boilerplate and Chrome Dev Tools. The boilerplate helped my site become more adaptable with high performance. Chrome Dev Tools taught me some new keyboard shortcuts, how to disable JavaScript, edit CSS, and analyze the site’s performance. My favorite things from it were discovering pretty print, multiple cursors, device mode, and the security check. We were learning about grids for a good two weeks. Generating grids was one of the easiest things I learned here because it was easy math and I liked how the grid layout turned out everytime. Next was media queries, we went from mobile view, to tablet, to desktop/laptop, this was for our resume. I absolutely love playing games like CSS Grid Garden. I wish we could’ve played more games like that in order to get a better understanding of the assignments a little better, but other than that I liked it. We later did a lab with bootstrap, and oh my goodness, I loved it! Learning audio/video was pretty easy and straightforward. I learned how important it is to check your Google Analytics for a number of reasons such as checking engagement reports, advertisements, monetization, and real-time reporting. Overall, you get a better insight on all the activity and productivity within your app or website such as the “ualr.edu” site. I became a little sick the day before you taught Geolocation, but I viewed the recording and learned about that as well. Some of the properties for it include coords.latitude, coords.longitude, coords.altitude, coords.accuracy, coords.heading, coords.speed, and timestamp. Last thing we learned was web hosting. It turns out some of the best providers in 2022 include Ionos, NameCheap (which I have heard of), and HostGator. Ionos has great security features and lots of traffic, but the builder costs extra and the plan prices increase over time. NameCheap has very affordable plans and their builder is free, but there’s no 24 hour phone support like other web hosters. HostGator has a free site and domain, but in order to restore data from your backup, it costs extra. cPanel is open source and has been around for quite a while. It is a great management and user-friendly platform that lets customers focus on growing their businesses.</p>
