     <p>Grew Up: in an orphanage in San Ricardo, Spain, after being abandoned in a basket on the side of the road. He was taken in by Imelda and cared for like her own child. Puss and Humpty Dumpty were partners in crime from a young age, always finding trouble around town, but always getting each other’s backs whenever things went sour.</p>
     <p>Living: as a dastardly assassin. Puss is hired by King Harold to assassinate Shrek, an ogre. But when his assassination attempt fails and he is captured, Shrek spares his life, for which Puss swears an oath to serve Shrek. But Shrek’s current sidekick Donkey also swore an oath to Shrek for saving his life, so soon both Donkey and Puss are vying for the big ogre’s favor as the better companion. Considering Shrek barely seems to want a companion at all, it can be a tough, thankless battle.</p>
     <p>Profession: mercenary. Puss is a renowned swashbuckler and expert thief. All of the fighting and stealing of his youth paid off when it came time to choose a career path. However, Puss gives up his murderous ways and becomes a full-time companion of Shrek, aiding him on any mission he might be undertaking.</p>
     <p>Interests: swordplay, yarn balls, catnip, and boots. Puss acts like a dashing warrior – and he is – but he has a soft spot for anything cute, and immediately reverts to his cute, big-eyed, kitty self whenever the occasion arises. He just can’t help himself.</p>
     <p>Relationship Status: a player. Puss is a womanizer…or perhaps a better word is a "kitty-izer." With his suave voice and good looks, Puss can woo any damsel, whether she’s currently in distress or not.</p>
     <p>Challenge: working together with Donkey to help Shrek. Puss at first finds it impossible to get along with Donkey, but with a little team work, they can learn to become the perfect counterparts, filling all the necessary roles to help Shrek – especially when the ogre’s in grave danger.</p>
     <p>Personality: charming and aggressive. Puss is a force to be reckoned with. The only thing that outweighs his skills with a sword is his talent for melting hearts with his saucer-shaped eyes and cute kitty face. But of course, Puss is best known for his knee-high leather boots, which he dons along with a hat to complete his signature look. Puss looks good, and he knows it.</p>
