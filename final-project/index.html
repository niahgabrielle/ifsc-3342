        <p><span class="main-character">S</span>hrek grew up apart from human society. Constantly chased by torch-toting mobs and angry farmers, Shrek learned to scare people away first with his ogre-ish demeanor and booming growl so they wouldn’t come close enough to hurt him – physically or emotionally. Living: alone in a swamp, deep in a mystical forest. Shrek basks in his daily habits and rituals, including bathing in mud, eating grubs, and ear-wax-candle-lit dinners. He loves seclusion, and when humans come to bother him, he quickly fizzles their posse with a classic ogre threat – though Shrek is not one to actually act on his ferocity. Shrek simply puts on the front of mean, green eating machine so he’ll be left alone, while in fact being rather peaceful despite his size and appearance. “Ogres are like onions,” says Shrek. “Onion haves layers. Ogres have layers. You get it? We both have layers.” We got it, Shrek. Visiting: Duloc, a kingdom ruled by Lord Farquaad. It resembles a theme park, but Shrek isn’t here to have fun. He came – with his trusty yet insufferable companion Donkey – because Lord Farquaad had dumped tons of fairy tale creatures in Shrek’s swamp. Shrek was outraged, his peace and quiet stolen by a bunch of annoying (to him, anyway) magical beings. Lord Farquaad will pay dearly. Interests: spending time alone, routines, and the simple life. Shrek’s lonely life is called into question when Donkey shows up and won’t shut up, forcing Shrek to engage in social conversation – which Shrek claims to hate. Relationship Status single. He’s not looking for love. But when Lord Farquaad challenges him to rescue a beautiful princess from a dragon’s lair, Shrek is all ears, because the reward is that Lord Farquaad will remove the fairy tale creatures from Shrek’s swamp. Plus, Shrek gets to save a beautiful princess – that’s not so bad either. Challenge: regaining his solitude. Shrek is fighting for the quiet life he had before all of this happened. But after the quest is complete, Shrek may not still want the same thing. Donkey and, later, Princess Fiona may cause Shrek to change his life forever. Personality: clever, self-sufficient, disgusting, and proud of it. Shrek also has a strong sense of right and wrong, and although he usually puts himself before anyone else, he repeatedly saves Donkey and comes to his aid. Shrek likes to bluster that he only cares about himself and his beloved peace and quiet, but this ogre has a heart as big as his swamp.</p>

        <p><span class="second-main">F</span>iona grew up under a fierce enchantment. The spell kept her locked in a castle protected by a fire-breathing dragon, where “she waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love, and true love's first kiss.” Like something out of a fairy tale, Fiona grew up waiting for her Prince Charming. Living: through a botched rescue. Instead of a handsome young prince, Shrek the ogre ended up saving Fiona from the dragon’s keep. Along with his trusty sidekick, the very chatty Donkey, Shrek is about the furthest thing from the dreamy “happily ever after” that Fiona spent her whole life expecting. But she’s making due as best she can. Profession: princess. Fiona is straight out of the fairy tales: the kind of princess whose job, like Rapunzel, is to wait in a high tower for a man to come to her rescue. Perhaps more than anything, Fiona has actually been waiting to take her destiny into her own hands. And with the constraints of captivity lifted at last, she finally has the chance to break free from it all. Interests: high-pitched singing, kung fu. Fiona can hold her own in a fight. She helps Shrek beat the wind out of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Relationship Status: single. She’s been waiting for Prince Charming all her life, or at least a charming prince. But now that she’s been rescued by an ogre who wants to marry her to Lord Farquaad—the height-challenged (and ethics-challenged) ruler who sent Shrek to retrieve her—Fiona is a cross roads. Fiona seems to be warming up to Shrek, but in what fairy tale has a beautiful princess ever ended up with an ogre? Challenge: struggling with her identity. Fiona must decide whether she is truly the beautiful princess she appears to be, or if she’s something altogether different, something a lot more like Shrek. Very odd things happen to her at night, but is that just another curse than can be lifted? Personality: spunky and reserved. She has been taught the niceties of being a princess, but she has a tomboyish side. She’s also hesitant to truly let others in, keeping some powerful secrets that she has trouble sharing with others. But who can blame her? She’s been cooped up alone in a tall tower guarded by a dragon for years</p>

        <h2>DONKEY</h2>

      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="lead-animal">D</span>onkey grew up with his owner, an old lady who later wishes to pawn him off for a reward because he’s a magical talking donkey. Living: right now with Shrek, an ogre, in Shrek’s cottage in the middle of a swamp. Donkey is indebted to Shrek for saving him from some evil knights, so even though Shrek doesn’t want anything to do with him, Donkey remains by his side, loyal as a pet dog. Donkey even sleeps outside when Shrek won’t let him in; luckily, Shrek pities the shivering donkey and gives him a blanket. Soon, they’re the best of friends. At least Donkey considers Shrek his best friend; Shrek isn’t always so sure. Profession: talking donkey, though that’s not a job so much as a way of life. Yet Donkey is ready for something more. When he accompanies Shrek on a quest to save a princess from a dragon’s lair, the princess declares him a “noble steed.” Donkey is beside himself with joy, telling Shrek: “All right, I hope you heard that. She called me a ‘noble steed.’ She thinks I'm a steed!” So sure, let’s call Donkey’s profession “noble steed.” Interests: talking, singing, waffles, and parfaits. Relationship Status: single. He’s alone in this world for now, but his heart is wide open, and any creature who tickles his fancy could easily become Donkey’s one and only. He does meet a dragon who develops a serious crush on him, but do they have enough in common? Challenge: balancing out Shrek. Donkey is constantly struggling to get Shrek to look on the brighter side of life, to give up his grumpiness and sing along with Donkey. It’s a hard road to walk: changing a bitter ogre into a happy companion. But Donkey just might know the way into anyone’s heart: “In the morning…I’m making waffles!”Personality: sunny, talkative, energetic. Donkey is living proof that if you’re annoying enough you can change the world. Donkey’s harassment is the only reason that Shrek does, well, anything. Donkey also gets bonus points for bringing a dragon to the team. Donkey never seems to stop running his mouth, or his little hooves for that matter. Whether he’s fleeing from a fire-breathing dragon, or just dancing to the tune of his own voice, Donkey is as spry as a child. Sadly, his wits might resemble those of a child as well. But that never gets him down!</p>

          <h2>PUSS IN BOOTS</h2>

    <section>
        <div class="block">
          <p><span class="second-lead-animal">P</span>Grew Up: in an orphanage in San Ricardo, Spain, after being abandoned in a basket on the side of the road. He was taken in by Imelda and cared for like her own child. Puss and Humpty Dumpty were partners in crime from a young age, always finding trouble around town, but always getting each other’s backs whenever things went sour. Living: as a dastardly assassin. Puss is hired by King Harold to assassinate Shrek, an ogre. But when his assassination attempt fails and he is captured, Shrek spares his life, for which Puss swears an oath to serve Shrek. But Shrek’s current sidekick Donkey also swore an oath to Shrek for saving his life, so soon both Donkey and Puss are vying for the big ogre’s favor as the better companion. Considering Shrek barely seems to want a companion at all, it can be a tough, thankless battle. Profession: mercenary. Puss is a renowned swashbuckler and expert thief. All of the fighting and stealing of his youth paid off when it came time to choose a career path. However, Puss gives up his murderous ways and becomes a full-time companion of Shrek, aiding him on any mission he might be undertaking. Interests: swordplay, yarn balls, catnip, and boots. Puss acts like a dashing warrior – and he is – but he has a soft spot for anything cute, and immediately reverts to his cute, big-eyed, kitty self whenever the occasion arises. He just can’t help himself. Relationship Status: a player. Puss is a womanizer…or perhaps a better word is a "kitty-izer." With his suave voice and good looks, Puss can woo any damsel, whether she’s currently in distress or not. Challenge: working together with Donkey to help Shrek. Puss at first finds it impossible to get along with Donkey, but with a little team work, they can learn to become the perfect counterparts, filling all the necessary roles to help Shrek – especially when the ogre’s in grave danger. Personality: charming and aggressive. Puss is a force to be reckoned with. The only thing that outweighs his skills with a sword is his talent for melting hearts with his saucer-shaped eyes and cute kitty face. But of course, Puss is best known for his knee-high leather boots, which he dons along with a hat to complete his signature look. Puss looks good, and he knows it.</p>
