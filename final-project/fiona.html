     <p>Grew Up: under a fierce enchantment. The spell kept her locked in a castle protected by a fire-breathing dragon, where “she waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love, and true love's first kiss.” Like something out of a fairy tale, Fiona grew up waiting for her Prince Charming.</p>
     <p>Living: through a botched rescue. Instead of a handsome young prince, Shrek the ogre ended up saving Fiona from the dragon’s keep. Along with his trusty sidekick, the very chatty Donkey, Shrek is about the furthest thing from the dreamy “happily ever after” that Fiona spent her whole life expecting. But she’s making due as best she can.</p>
     <p>Profession: princess. Fiona is straight out of the fairy tales: the kind of princess whose job, like Rapunzel, is to wait in a high tower for a man to come to her rescue. Perhaps more than anything, Fiona has actually been waiting to take her destiny into her own hands. And with the constraints of captivity lifted at last, she finally has the chance to break free from it all.</p>
     <p>Interests: high-pitched singing, kung fu. Fiona can hold her own in a fight. She helps Shrek beat the wind out of Robin Hood and his Merry Men.</p>
     <p>Relationship Status: single. She’s been waiting for Prince Charming all her life, or at least a charming prince. But now that she’s been rescued by an ogre who wants to marry her to Lord Farquaad—the height-challenged (and ethics-challenged) ruler who sent Shrek to retrieve her—Fiona is a cross roads. Fiona seems to be warming up to Shrek, but in what fairy tale has a beautiful princess ever ended up with an ogre?</p>
     <p>Challenge: struggling with her identity. Fiona must decide whether she is truly the beautiful princess she appears to be, or if she’s something altogether different, something a lot more like Shrek. Very odd things happen to her at night, but is that just another curse than can be lifted?</p>
     <p>Personality: spunky and reserved. She has been taught the niceties of being a princess, but she has a tomboyish side. She’s also hesitant to truly let others in, keeping some powerful secrets that she has trouble sharing with others. But who can blame her? She’s been cooped up alone in a tall tower guarded by a dragon for years.</p>
